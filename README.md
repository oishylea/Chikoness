### Hi there 👋

I'm a part-time computer science degree student who has work experiences as a programmer/artist in a game studio in Malaysia. 

I also possess a Bachelor of Multimedia (Hons) in Film and Animation with 6 years of work experience as a 3D animator. 

I have worked with a range of programming languages and frameworks, ranging from front-end such as Vue and React, to back-end (Node.js, Express) as well as Firebase and MongoDB to hosting all of them on GCP Compute Engine and Huawei Cloud.
